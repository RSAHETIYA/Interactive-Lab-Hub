# Project Plan

Sam Willenson (shw58), Rahul Sahetiya (rs2248)

## Big Idea
We will be creating two pianos that will be linked together to facilitate a teaching experience. Keys played on one piano will translate into LEDs on the keys of the
other piano turning on and vice versa. Eventually, it will be possible to add a Simon game type of functionality to the keyboard to add another way to interact with the 
devices.

## Timeline
Week 1 (11/15 - 11/22): 
- Make sure all parts needed are available
- Look into music libraries and communication protocols to use
- Design both keyboards and possibly start prototyping

Week 2 (11/22 - 11/29) - “Demonstrate that your project is functioning well enough for somebody to use and interact with it. This presentation will just be to the 
teaching team.”
- Finish writing code for music functionality of piano
- Complete building two rough prototypes of pianos
- Demonstrate functionality with one “teaching” piano and one “learning” piano

Week 3 (11/29 - 12/6):
- Polish both prototypes
- Expand functionality to allow for teaching to work both ways
- Develop Simon game if time permits

Week 4 (12/6 - 12/13):
- Complete documentation and other written parts as needed

## Parts Needed 
The part we are envisioning to use are:
- Cardboard
- Laser cutter or normal cutting tools
- Copper tape as electrolytic contacts
- Capacitive touch sensor
- Wire to route between sensor and contacts
- LED lights
- 2x LCD screen
- Speakers

## Risks/Contingencies
- Multi-key press if sensing is not precise enough
- Simon game proves too difficult to develop
- Can’t acquire all parts in time
- Program to control music functionality is inefficient causing a delayed sound
- Messaging protocol in use is very delayed/high latency

## Fall Back Plan
The biggest stretch for this project is making and implementing the Simon game functionality. If unable to, given our current plans, we should still be able to 
complete and polish two keyboards that have teaching/learning functionality. It also might not be feasible to implement the teaching/learning both ways, so we will 
need to fall back to one piano being dedicated for learning and the other piano being dedicated to teaching. If we encounter some errors with the capacitive touch
sensing, it should still be possible to simulate a good key press system using normal buttons or maybe limit switches.
